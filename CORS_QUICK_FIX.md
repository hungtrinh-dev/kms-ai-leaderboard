# Quick Fix for CORS Errors - Summary

## What I've Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Added Automatic Retry Logic
Your application now automatically retries failed requests up to 3 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 6s delays).

### 2. ‚úÖ Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages for users
- Clear retry attempt indicators
- Automatic fallback to CSV backup data

### 3. ‚úÖ Added Cache Busting
Prevents browser caching issues by adding timestamps to each request.

### 4. ‚úÖ Increased Timeout
Changed from 5 seconds to 10 seconds to handle slower connections.

## What You Need to Do (IMPORTANT!)

### **Fix the Root Cause - Redeploy Google Apps Script**

The CORS error happens because your Google Apps Script is redirecting to a login page. Follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Redeploy with Public Access

1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Go to **Extensions** ‚Üí **Apps Script**
3. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **New deployment**
4. Select type: **Web app**
5. **CRITICAL**: Set "Who has access" to **"Anyone"** (not "Anyone within KMS")
6. Click **Deploy** and authorize
7. Copy the NEW deployment URL

#### Step 2: Update Your Code

Replace the URL in `index.html` (around line 2913):

```javascript
// OLD - Domain-scoped URL (causes CORS)
const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/a/macros/kms-technology.com/s/AKfycbyaefNITlvUqSZ4nX5Sc-CyqbTX5_xJ85GTtJEl_YXlGUIbsq9HAiK6gt1YMe5PXjE/exec';

// NEW - Replace with your new deployment URL
const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec';
```

**Important**: Use the `/macros/s/` URL format, NOT `/a/macros/`

#### Step 3: Test

Open this URL in your browser (replace with your actual URL):
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec?action=getLeaderboard&callback=test
```

**Expected result**: `test({success: true, individual: [...], team: [...]})`
**Wrong result**: Login page or redirect

## What's New in Your Code

### Enhanced Retry System
```javascript
function loadLeaderboardData(retryCount = 0) {
    const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
    
    // Automatic retry with exponential backoff
    // Retry delays: 2s, 4s, 6s
    // Shows retry progress to users
    // Falls back to CSV after max retries
}
```

### Features Added:
- üîÑ **Auto-retry**: 3 attempts with smart delays
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Longer timeout**: 10s instead of 5s
- üîî **User notifications**: Success/error messages
- üöÄ **Cache busting**: Prevents stale data
- üìä **Progress indicator**: Shows retry attempts
- üíæ **Fallback**: Uses CSV backup if all retries fail

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Redeploy Google Apps Script with "Anyone" access
- [ ] Update `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` in index.html
- [ ] Test deployment URL in browser (should show JSON, not login)
- [ ] Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
- [ ] Test in incognito/private mode
- [ ] Check browser console for retry logs
- [ ] Verify leaderboard loads successfully

## Why This Happens

Your current URL format:
```
https://script.google.com/a/macros/kms-technology.com/s/.../exec
```

The `/a/macros/kms-technology.com/` part means:
- Domain-restricted deployment
- Requires KMS domain authentication
- Can cause CORS issues with public access

**Solution**: Use public deployment format:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec
```

## Quick Debug

If you still see errors:

1. **Check browser console** (F12):
   ```
   Look for: "Script load error, retry count: X"
   ```

2. **Watch retry attempts**:
   ```
   Loading screen will show: "Retry attempt 1/3"
   ```

3. **Check notifications**:
   - Success: Green notification on successful retry
   - Error: Red notification after all retries fail

4. **Verify CSV fallback**:
   - After 3 failed attempts, should load CSV backup
   - Check console for: "falling back to CSV"

## Immediate Actions

1. **Priority 1**: Redeploy Google Apps Script with "Anyone" access
2. **Priority 2**: Update `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` with new deployment URL
3. **Priority 3**: Test and verify

The enhanced retry logic will help temporarily, but fixing the deployment is the permanent solution!

**TL;DR**: Your code now has smart retries, but you MUST redeploy your Google Apps Script with "Anyone" access and update the URL to permanently fix CORS errors.
