# Alternative Solutions for CORS Issues with Google Apps Script

## ðŸš¨ CORS Problem
Google Apps Script doesn't support CORS properly, which causes browser errors when trying to submit forms via JavaScript fetch/XMLHttpRequest.

## âœ… Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Google Forms (Recommended - Easiest)

#### Step 1: Create a Google Form
1. Go to [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com)
2. Create a new form with these fields:
   - Full Name (Short answer)
   - Email (Short answer)
   - Department (Multiple choice)
   - Submission Type (Multiple choice)
   - Title (Short answer)
   - Description (Paragraph)
   - Tags (Short answer)

#### Step 2: Get the Form URL
1. Click "Send" in your Google Form
2. Copy the form URL (looks like: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/FORM_ID/formResponse`)

#### Step 3: Update the HTML
Replace the current form submission with this simpler approach:

```javascript
// Google Form submission (no CORS issues)
const GOOGLE_FORM_URL = 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/YOUR_FORM_ID/formResponse';

// Form field mapping (get these from Google Form)
const FORM_FIELDS = {
    fullName: 'entry.123456789',
    email: 'entry.987654321',
    department: 'entry.456789123',
    submissionType: 'entry.789123456',
    title: 'entry.321654987',
    description: 'entry.654987321',
    tags: 'entry.147258369'
};
```

### Option 2: Use the Current Apps Script with iframe (Current Implementation)

The current implementation I've created uses an iframe method that should work around CORS:

#### How it works:
1. Creates a hidden form with the data
2. Submits to an iframe to avoid page redirect
3. Handles success/error through iframe events

#### To make it work:
1. Make sure your Google Apps Script is deployed as "Web app"
2. Set "Execute as: Me"
3. Set "Who has access: Anyone" (this is crucial for CORS)

### Option 3: Use a Proxy Server

If you want to keep the current setup, you can use a CORS proxy:

```javascript
const CORS_PROXY = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/';
const response = await fetch(CORS_PROXY + GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Solution: Google Forms

### Why Google Forms is Better:
1. **No CORS Issues**: Built-in support for cross-origin requests
2. **Easier Setup**: No Apps Script coding required
3. **Built-in Validation**: Google handles validation automatically
4. **Automatic Responses**: Can send confirmation emails
5. **Data Collection**: Automatically creates a response sheet
6. **Mobile Friendly**: Google Forms are fully responsive

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Create Google Form** with matching fields
2. **Get entry IDs** by inspecting form HTML
3. **Update JavaScript** to use form submission method
4. **Test submission** - should work immediately

Would you like me to implement the Google Forms solution or help you fix the current Apps Script CORS issue?
